controls (playback) design is located in exo_player_control_view.xml.

Overrides for control button styles (for sizes) are in themes.xml.

play/pause icons from https://icon-sets.iconify.design/gravity-ui/. They go in:
app/src/main/res/drawable, then an xml file needs to be created, and it's assigned
in the exo_styled_controls_play.xml and exo_styled_controls_pause.xml files.
NOTE: the svg's must be deleted once the xml conversion is created.

For intro beginning / ending, maybe indicate the start and stop on a
screenshot of the current frame instead of a time, as different streams
may have different lengths.
